# rutht
A lisp interpreter written in Rust

# Summary
That's pretty much the whole project. The (far away) end goal will likely be a program to interpret a subset of Common Lisp, but as of right now all I am going for is a small, Lisp-like language.

The only functions I have concrete plans to implement are the ones detailed in section 3 of [John McCarthy's original Lisp paper](http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/recursive.html)

I am aware that the structure of a system to compile Lisp is in section 4, but I thought it would be more fun to wing it. If I end up needing help (which I probably will) then I will likely end up referencing it.
